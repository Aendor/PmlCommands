## Introduction to PML2

AVEVAâ€™s **Programmable Macro Language (PML2)** is a flexible scripting language used to automate processes, customize interfaces, and create custom functions in AVEVA applications.

### Key Features

- **Data Types**: Supports common data types such as `STRING`, `REAL`, `BOOLEAN`, and `ARRAY`.
- **Control Structures**: Provides loops (`DO`, `DO VALUES`) and conditional statements (`IF`, `ELSE`) for flexible programming.
- **Custom Objects**: Define custom data structures with attributes and methods.
- **File Handling**: Read and write text files for data export and logging.
- **Advanced Operations**: Includes commands for environment queries, database modifications, and Excel data imports.

### How to Use This Guide

Each section of this guide is contained within its own Markdown file for focused reference:

- **[Variables and Data Types](Variables_and_Data_Types.md)**: Learn how to declare and use variables, including local and global scope, and data types.
- **[Control Flow](Control_Flow.md)**: Explore conditionals and loops to control the execution flow of your PML2 scripts.
- **[Functions and Procedures](Functions_and_Procedures.md)**: Understand how to create reusable functions and procedures, including return values.
- **[Collections and Objects](Collections_and_Objects.md)**: Dive into managing collections of objects and defining custom object types with attributes and methods.
- **[File Handling](File_Handling.md)**: See how to handle files in PML2, including reading, writing, and error handling.
- **[Advanced Examples and Patterns](Advanced_Examples.md)**: Browse practical examples, from exporting data to CSV to using environment variables and managing databases.
